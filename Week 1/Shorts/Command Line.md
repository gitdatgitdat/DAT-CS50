- Linux CLI

The CS50 IDE is a cloud based machine running Ubuntu.

Many modern distros will have a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow mouse based navigation. But you may find yourself working in a terminal. Some important commands include*:

ls = List the contents of your current directory.

cd = Change directory.
	^You can also just enter cd by itself to go to your home directory.

. = Current directory.

.. = Parent directory.

pwd = Present Working Directory, or show the name of the current directory you are in.

mkdir = Make directory.

cp = Copying one file from its source to a destination. If a folder, you would need to use the recursive flag, -r, to tell the OS to move the folder and all its contents to the destination.

rm = Remove a file or directory. This will ask you to confirm the action unless you place a flag like -f, force. For a directory you would use -r again.

mv = Move a file or directory from one location to another. You could also use it to rename a file or directory.

- Bonus round:

chmod = Change mode, referring to file permissions (Read, write, execute).

ln = Link one file to another.

touch = Create or duplicate a timestamp.

rmdir = Remove directory. Will only work on empty directories.

man = Help page that shows the user MANual.

diff = Compare the files line by line and show the DIFFerences.

sudo = Super User Do for running commands with admin privileges.

Clear = Clear the terminal screen.

Telnet = Unsecure SSH connection between machines.

*This is for Linux and macOS. Windows uses slightly different commands.
