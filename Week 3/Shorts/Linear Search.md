Linear search the idea is to iterate across the array form left to right searching for a specified element.

Repeat, starting at the first element
	If the first element is the atrget, stop
	Else, move to next element
	
If what we're searching for isn't in the array, we can still run a linear search. After running through the array, the search will say it failed to find that element.

Worst case, this will have to look through every element.

Best case, the target is the first element.
